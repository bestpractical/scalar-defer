=head1 NAME

Scalar::Defer - Lazy evaluation in Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Scalar::Defer; # exports 'defer', 'lazy' and 'force'

    my ($x, $y);
    my $dv = defer { ++$x };    # a deferred value (not memoized)
    my $lv = lazy { ++$y };     # a lazy value (memoized)

    print "$dv $dv $dv"; # 1 2 3
    print "$lv $lv $lv"; # 1 1 1

    my $forced = force $dv;     # force a normal value out of $dv

    print "$forced $forced $forced"; # 4 4 4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports two functions, C<defer> and C<lazy>, for constructing
values that are evaluated on demand.  It also exports a C<force> function
to force evaluation of a deferred value.

=head2 defer {...}

Takes a block or a code reference, and returns a deferred value.
Each time that value is demanded, the block is evaluated again to
yield a fresh result.

=head2 lazy {...}

Like C<defer>, except the value is computed at most once.  Subsequent
evaluation will simply use the cached result.

=head2 force $value

Force evaluation of a deferred value to return a normal value.
If C<$value> was already a normal value, then C<force> simply returns it.

=head2 is_deferred $value

Tells whether the argument is a deferred value or not. (Lazy values are
deferred too.)

The C<is_deferred> function is not exported by default; to import it, name
it explicitly in the import list.

=head1 NOTES

Deferred values are not considered objects (C<ref> on them returns C<0>),
although you can still call methods on them, in which case the invocant
is always the forced value.

Unlike the C<tie>-based L<Data::Lazy>, this module operates on I<values>,
not I<variables>.  Therefore, assigning another value into C<$dv> and C<$lv>
above will simply replace the value, instead of triggering a C<STORE> method
call.

Similarily, assigning C<$dv> or C<$dv> into another variable will not trigger
a C<FETCH> method, but simply propagates the deferred value over without
evaluationg.  This makes it much faster than a C<tie>-based implementation
-- even under the worst case scenario, where it's always immediately forced
after creation, this module is still twice as fast than L<Data::Lazy>.

=head1 CAVEATS

Bad things may happen if this module interacts with any other code which
fiddles with package C<0>.

Performance of creating new deferred or lazy values can be quite poor
under perl 5.8.9.  This is due a bugfix since 5.8.8, where re-blessing
an overloaded object caused bad interactions with other references to
the same value.  5.8.9's solution involves walking the arenas to find
all other references to the same object, which can cause C<bless> (and
thus L<Scalar::Defer/defer>) to be up to three orders of magnitude
slower than usual.  perl 5.10.0 and higher do not suffer from this
problem.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Data::Thunk>, which implements C<lazy> values that can replace itself
upon forcing, leaving a minimal trace of the thunk, with some sneaky XS
magic in L<Data::Swap>.
