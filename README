NAME
    Scalar::Defer - Calculate values on demand

SYNOPSIS
        use Scalar::Defer; # exports 'defer' and 'lazy'

        my ($x, $y);
        my $dv = defer { ++$y };    # a defer-value (not memoized)
        my $lv = lazy { ++$x };     # a lazy-value (memoized)

        print "$dv $dv $dv"; # 1 2 3
        print "$lv $lv $lv"; # 1 1 1

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports two functions, "defer" and "lazy", for building
    values that are evaluated on demand.

  defer {...}
    Takes a block or a code reference, and returns an overloaded value. Each
    time that value is demanded, the block is evaluated again to yield a
    fresh result.

  lazy {...}
    Like "defer", except the value is computed at most once. Subsequent
    evaluation will simly use the cached result.

NOTES
    Unlike the "tie" based Data::Lazy, this module operates on *values*, not
    *variables*. Therefore, assigning into $t simply replaces the value.

    The "overload" based implementation also makes this module about 2x
    faster than Data::Lazy.
