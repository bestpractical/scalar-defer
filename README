NAME
    Data::Thunk - Calculate values on demand

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::Thunk; # exports "lazy" and "thunk"

        my ($x, $y);
        my $l = lazy { ++$x };
        my $t = thunk { ++$y };

        print "$l $l $l"; # 1 2 3
        print "$t $t $t"; # 1 1 1

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports two functions, "lazy" and "thunk", for building
    values that are evaluated on demand.

  lazy {...}
    Takes a block or a code reference, and returns an overloaded value. Each
    time that value is demanded, the block is evaluated again to yield a
    fresh value.

  thunk {...}
    Like "lazy", except the value is computed at most once. Subsequent
    evaluation will simly use the cached value.

NOTES
    Unlike the "tie" based Data::Lazy, this module operates on *values*, not
    *variables*. Therefore, assigning into $t simply replaces the value.

    The "overload" based implementation also makes this module about 2x
    faster than Data::Lazy.
